Installing the Commutator Pro at an angle may lead to increased acoustic noise and accelerated mechanical wear. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Commutator_PRO/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"Step 1: Powering the commutator      The Commutator Pro can be powered via either the USB-C port or the DC jack. When using the USB-C port\u2014particularly during remote operation under PC control\u2014ensure a stable 5V, 1A power supply, compliant with USB 3.0 or USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) specifications. Powering the device with only 5V, 0.5A (typical of USB 2.0) may result in unreliable performance, including failure to power on or disruptions in motion tracking.   Battery Charging  <p>If your Commutator Pro is equipped with an internal battery (models designated with -B), the battery will begin charging automatically when power is connected. During charging, the front-panel battery level indicator LEDs will flash and illuminate progressively to reflect the current charge level, indicating active charging (see LED Indicators section for details).</p> <p>Once fully charged, all four power LEDs will remain steadily illuminated. The Commutator Pro is equipped with an integrated Battery Management System (BMS) that prevents overcharging, making it safe to leave the device plugged in during operation. </p> <p>A full charge takes approximately 7 hours, and under normal operating conditions, the device can run for up to 6-9 hours on a full charge.</p> <p></p> <p></p>  Step 2: Connecting to the XDAQ      Use the supplied DAQ cable to connect between a XDAQ headstage port and the appropriate headstage port (Neuropixels or HDMI) of the Commutator Pro.  <p></p> <p></p>  Step 3: Connecting the Headstage Cable to the Rotating Interface  <p>To connect the headstage cable to the Commutator Pro, locate the headstage port(s) positioned on the underside of the device, which serves as the rotating interface of the commutator. </p>     Identify the appropriate port based on the headstage type (HDMI or Neuropixels) as labeled near each connector. Carefully align the headstage cable connector with the corresponding port and insert it straight and firmly until it is securely seated. These ports are designed to maintain a stable connection while allowing continuous rotation during operation.  <p></p> <p></p>  \u26a0 IMPORTANT:      - Ensure the cable is connected to the correct port.     - Avoid twisting or pulling the cable during installation.     - It is recommended to power off the device before making connections to prevent hardware damage.     Once connected, signal input from the headstage will be routed through the commutator and transmitted to the corresponding output port on the top of the commutator base.  <p></p>  Step 4: Managing excess cable      When connecting the headstage cable to the Commutator Pro, the signal pathway begins at the rotating interface and exits through the fixed-side rotor side ports. After selecting the appropriate rotor side port (e.g., HDMI or Neuropixels), the user may route the cable toward the downstream recording amplifier.      To ensure stable cable handling during rotation and prevent signal artifacts caused by tension or displacement, proper cable management is essential.     Route the cable as illustrated below and securely lock the cable using the integrated screw clips, ensuring that adequate slack is maintained to prevent tension on the headstage connection and to allow smooth rotation of the commutator.  <p></p> <p></p> <p>     \u26a0 IMPORTANT: It is important to leave a small amount of slack in the cable to prevent tension that could affect the device's movement and sensitivity. </p> <p></p>  Step 5: Sensor configuration      The Commutator Pro can be driven using a compatible animal side gyro sensor or the integrated magnetic encoder. Note: the IMU sensor found in the X-Headstage or Intan stock recording headstages is not compatible with the Commutator Pro.  Gyro Sensor Models (designated with -I or -IH)  <li> I Model: </li>     Connect the integrated gyro sensor cable to the GYRO port on the rotating interface.     <li> IH Model: </li>     Disconnect the integrated gyro sensor cable from the GYRO port, if applicable. Connect a custom headstage that includes a compatible and integrated gyro sensor to the HDMI cable.  <p> NOTE: If no compatible headstage is available, connect the integrated gyro sensor cable instead. The device will not function correctly if both custom gyro headstage and integrated gyro sensor cable are connected. </p> <p></p>  Magnetic Sensor Model (designated with -M)      This configuration uses the integrated magnetic encoder located on the rotating interface to detect cable rotation. It eliminates the need for the external gyro sensor. No setup is necessary, proceed to the next step.  Combined Gyro &amp; Magnetic Sensor Model (designated with -MI)  <li> To use Gyro sensor as the primary input: </li>     If your Commutator Pro supports both gyro and magnetic Sensor:     <li> IH Model: </li>     Plug the integrated gyro sensor cable into the GYRO port on the rotating interface. When a valid gyro signal is detected, the magnetic encoder input will be automatically ignored.     <li> To switch to Magnetic encoder sensor: </li>     Disconnect the gyro sensor cable. Release the lock screw securing the cable encoder attached to the magnetic encoder.  <p></p>  \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Bottom view \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Front view  <p></p> <p> NOTE: When using the gyro sensor, ensure the lock screw is fastened to secure the cable encoder in place. </p> <p>     \u26a0 IMPORTANT: The gyro sensor must be connected to the Commutator PRO before powering on to ensure proper operation. </p> <p></p>  Step 6: Connecting GPIO      This interface allows users to transmit analog or digital signals from external equipments. The signal enters via the fixed-side GPIO DB9 port and is routed directly to the rotating-side port, enabling seamless integration with devices mounted on the animal.     A pre-assembled cable for accessing the rotating-side GPIO is available for purchase from Digi-Key or Mouser. To locate compatible options, search for 'JST SH' connector (10-pin).  <p> NOTE: GPIO signal can be routed through the HDMI port at the expense of reduction of maximum supported number of headstage channels. Contact us for the customization. Such customization should be done at the time of the order. </p> <p></p> <p></p>  \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Bottom view  <p></p>  Step 7: Connecting to the headstage, setting up Gyro sensor and turning on   Connect the headstage cable to the headstage  <p></p> <p></p>  Attach Gyro Sensor to the Headstage or Cable  <li> Attach the gyro sensor to the headstage or the headstage cable using adhesive or other suitable methods. </li> <li> Ensure the sensor is perpendicular to the moving plane and parallel to the cable; do not rotate its orientation. </li> <p></p> <p></p>  Power On  <p> Press and hold the power button for one second.
